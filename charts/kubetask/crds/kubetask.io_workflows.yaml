                                        If specified, the context content is written to this file path.
                                        Example: "${WORKSPACE_DIR}/guides/coding-standards.md"

                                        If NOT specified (empty), the context content is appended to ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md

                                        in a structured XML format:

                                        This allows multiple contexts to be aggregated into a single task.md file,

                                  IMPORTANT: When humanInTheLoop is enabled, the Agent MUST also specify the Command field.
                                  The controller wraps the command to add a sleep after completion.
                                  Without Command in the Agent, the controller cannot wrap the entrypoint.
