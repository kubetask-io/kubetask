              cleanup:
                description: |-
                  Cleanup configures automatic cleanup of completed Tasks.
                  When configured, completed/failed Tasks are automatically deleted based on
                  TTL (time-to-live) and/or retention count policies.
                  If not specified, Tasks are not automatically deleted (default behavior).
                properties:
                  maxRetainedTasks:
                    description: |-
                      MaxRetainedTasks specifies the maximum number of completed/failed Tasks to retain
                      per namespace. When exceeded, the oldest Tasks (by CompletionTime) are deleted first.
                      If unset or nil, retention-based cleanup is disabled.

                      Note: TTL cleanup takes precedence - Tasks exceeding TTL are deleted regardless
                      of this limit. This count only applies to Tasks that haven't exceeded TTL yet.

                      Example:
                        maxRetainedTasks: 100  # Keep at most 100 completed Tasks
                    format: int32
                    minimum: 0
                    type: integer
                  ttlSecondsAfterFinished:
                    description: |-
                      TTLSecondsAfterFinished specifies the TTL for cleaning up finished Tasks.
                      If set, completed/failed Tasks will be deleted after this duration from CompletionTime.
                      If unset or nil, TTL-based cleanup is disabled.

                      Example:
                        ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600  # Delete after 1 hour
                    format: int32
                    minimum: 0

              systemImage:
                description: |-
                  SystemImage configures the KubeOpenCode system image used for internal components
                  such as git-init and context-init containers.
                  If not specified, uses the built-in default image with IfNotPresent policy.
                properties:
                  image:
                    description: |-
                      Image specifies the system image to use for internal KubeOpenCode components.
                      If not specified, defaults to the built-in DefaultKubeOpenCodeImage.
                      Example: "quay.io/kubeopencode/kubeopencode:v0.2.0"

                      Defaults to IfNotPresent if not specified.
