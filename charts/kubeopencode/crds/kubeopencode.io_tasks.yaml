                  Contexts provides additional context for the task.
                  Contexts are processed in array order, with later contexts taking precedence.

                  Context priority (lowest to highest):
                    1. Agent.contexts (Agent-level defaults)
                    2. Task.contexts (Task-specific contexts)
                    3. Task.description (highest, becomes ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md)

                  Example:

                      - type: Text

                              - If Path is empty (entire repo): The mounted directory WILL contain .git/

                      description: |-
                        MountPath specifies where this context should be mounted in the agent pod.

                        Path resolution follows Tekton conventions:
                        - Absolute paths (starting with "/") are used as-is
                        - Relative paths (NOT starting with "/") are prefixed with the agent's workspaceDir

                        See ContextRef.MountPath for detailed examples.

                        Note: For Runtime context type, MountPath is ignored - content is always
                        appended to task.md.

                  Description is the task instruction/prompt.
                  The controller creates ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md with this content
                  (where WORKSPACE_DIR is configured in Agent.spec.workspaceDir, defaulting to "/workspace").
