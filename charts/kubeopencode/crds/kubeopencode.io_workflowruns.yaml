          WorkflowRun represents an execution instance of a Workflow.
          WorkflowRun can be created in two ways:
           1. Reference an existing Workflow template via workflowRef
           2. Define an inline workflow via inline spec

          WorkflowRun is the owner of all Task CRs it creates.
          When a WorkflowRun is deleted, all its child Tasks are garbage collected.

          WorkflowRun follows the same TTL cleanup policy as Task, configured
          in KubeTaskConfig.spec.taskLifecycle.ttlSecondsAfterFinished.
