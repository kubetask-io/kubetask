                  AgentRef references an Agent for this task.

              contexts:
                description: |-
                  Contexts provides additional context for the task.
                  Each context can be a reference to a Context CRD (via Ref) or an inline definition (via Inline).
                  Contexts are processed in array order, with later contexts taking precedence.

                  Context priority (lowest to highest):
                    1. Agent.contexts (Agent-level defaults)
                    2. Task.contexts (Task-specific contexts)
                    3. Task.description (highest, becomes ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md)

                  Example:
                    contexts:
                      - ref:
                          name: coding-standards
                      - inline:

                    ContextSource represents a context that can be either a reference to a Context CRD
                    or an inline definition. Exactly one of Ref or Inline must be specified.

                    This follows the same pattern as WorkflowRunSpec (workflowRef vs inline),
                    allowing users to choose between reusable Context CRDs or one-off inline definitions.

                                Note on .git directory:

                            Path resolution follows Tekton conventions:
                            - Absolute paths (starting with "/") are used as-is
                            - Relative paths (NOT starting with "/") are prefixed with the agent's workspaceDir

                            See ContextRef.MountPath for detailed examples.

                            Note: For Runtime context type, MountPath is ignored - content is always
                            appended to task.md.
