                  Contexts references Context CRDs to include in this task.
                  Each ContextMount specifies which Context to use and where to mount it.

                  Context priority (lowest to highest):
                    1. Agent.contexts (Agent-level defaults)
                    2. Task.contexts (Task-specific contexts)
                    3. Task.description (highest, becomes ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md)
                items:
                  description: |-
                    ContextMount references a Context resource and specifies how to mount it.
                    This allows the same Context to be mounted at different paths by different Tasks.
                  properties:
                    mountPath:
                      description: |-
                        MountPath specifies where this context should be mounted in the agent pod.
                        If specified, the context content is written to this file path.
                        Example: "${WORKSPACE_DIR}/guides/coding-standards.md"

                        If NOT specified (empty), the context content is appended to ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md
                        (where WORKSPACE_DIR is configured in Agent.spec.workspaceDir, defaulting to "/workspace")
                        in a structured XML format:
                          <context name="coding-standards" namespace="default" type="File">
                          ... content ...
                          </context>

                        This allows multiple contexts to be aggregated into a single task.md file,
                        which the agent can parse and understand.

                  Description is the task instruction/prompt.
                  The controller creates ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md with this content
                  (where WORKSPACE_DIR is configured in Agent.spec.workspaceDir, defaulting to "/workspace").
                  This is the primary way to tell the agent what to do.

                  Example:

                  HumanInTheLoop configures whether this task requires human participation.
                  When enabled, the agent container will remain running after task completion,
                  allowing users to exec into the container for debugging, review, or manual intervention.

                  IMPORTANT: When humanInTheLoop is enabled, the Agent MUST also specify the Command field.
                  The controller wraps the command to add a sleep after completion.
                  Without Command in the Agent, the controller cannot wrap the entrypoint.

                      Enabled indicates whether human-in-the-loop mode is active.
                      When true, the agent container will sleep after task completion
                      instead of exiting immediately.

                      Users can kubectl exec into the container during this period.
                      Uses standard Go duration format (e.g., "1h", "30m", "1h30m").

                      the human-in-the-loop session, enabling developers to test
