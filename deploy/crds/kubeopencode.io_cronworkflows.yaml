          CronWorkflow represents a scheduled workflow that runs on a cron schedule.
          CronWorkflow creates WorkflowRun resources at scheduled times, similar to how
          Kubernetes CronJob creates Jobs.

                                            Path resolution follows Tekton conventions:
                                            - Absolute paths (starting with "/") are used as-is
                                            - Relative paths (NOT starting with "/") are prefixed with the agent's workspaceDir

                                            See ContextRef.MountPath for detailed examples.

                                            Note: For Runtime context type, MountPath is ignored - content is always
                                            appended to task.md.

                                      Description is the task instruction/prompt.
                                      The controller creates ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md with this content
                                      (where WORKSPACE_DIR is configured in Agent.spec.workspaceDir, defaulting to "/workspace").
                                      This is the primary way to tell the agent what to do.

                                      Example:

                        If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                        referencing a part of an object.
