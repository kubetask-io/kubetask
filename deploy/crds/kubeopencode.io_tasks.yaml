                  the Pod runs in the Agent's namespace to keep credentials isolated.

                  If not specified and taskTemplateRef is set, uses the template's agentRef.
                  If neither is specified, uses the "default" Agent in the same namespace.

                  Contexts provides additional context for the task.
                  Contexts are processed in array order, with later contexts taking precedence.

                  Context priority (lowest to highest):
                    1. Agent.contexts (Agent-level defaults)
                    2. TaskTemplate.contexts (Template-level defaults, if taskTemplateRef is set)
                    3. Task.contexts (Task-specific contexts)
                    4. Task.description (highest, becomes ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md)

                  Example:

                        Path resolution follows Tekton conventions:
                        - Absolute paths (starting with "/") are used as-is
                        - Relative paths (NOT starting with "/") are prefixed with the agent's workspaceDir

                        If not specified, the content is appended to task.md with XML tags.

                        Note: For Runtime context type, MountPath is ignored - content is always
                        appended to task.md.

                          - Context deduplication (same-named contexts can override each other)
                        If not specified, a default name is generated based on the context type and index.
                      type: string

                      description: |-
                        Optional specifies whether this context is required for task execution.
                        If true, the task will proceed even if the context cannot be resolved
                        (e.g., ConfigMap not found, Git clone failed, URL fetch failed).
                        If false (default), the task will fail if the context cannot be resolved.

                        Note: This field takes precedence over type-specific optional fields
                        (e.g., configMap.optional). If both are specified, this field wins.

                  the template's description is used.

                  Example:

                type: string
              taskTemplateRef:
                description: |-
                  TaskTemplateRef references a TaskTemplate to use as base configuration.
                  The template's settings are merged with this Task's settings.

                  When using a template:
                    - TaskTemplate.agentRef is used if Task.agentRef is not specified
                    - TaskTemplate.contexts are prepended to Task.contexts
                    - TaskTemplate.description is used if Task.description is not specified

                  Example:
                    taskTemplateRef:
                      name: pr-task-template
                      namespace: platform-templates

                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.
