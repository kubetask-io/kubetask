                  Command specifies the entrypoint command for the agent container.
                  This is REQUIRED and overrides the default ENTRYPOINT of the container image.

                  The command defines HOW the agent executes tasks. Different users can
                  customize execution behavior (e.g., output format, flags) without
                  modifying the agent image. The agent image only provides the tools.

                  ## Example

                        Path resolution follows Tekton conventions:
                        - Absolute paths (starting with "/") are used as-is
                        - Relative paths (NOT starting with "/") are prefixed with the agent's workspaceDir

                        See ContextRef.MountPath for detailed examples.

                        Note: For Runtime context type, MountPath is ignored - content is always
                        appended to task.md.

                  Similar to GitHub Actions secrets, these can be mounted as files or

                  Example use cases:

                    Credential represents a secret that should be available to the agent.
                    Each credential references a Kubernetes Secret and specifies how to expose it.

                    Mounting behavior depends on whether SecretRef.Key is specified:

                    1. No Key specified + No MountPath: entire Secret as environment variables
                    2. No Key specified + MountPath: entire Secret as directory (each key becomes a file)
                    3. Key specified + Env: single key as environment variable
                    4. Key specified + MountPath: single key as file
                  properties:
                    env:
                      description: |-
                        Env specifies the environment variable name to expose the secret value.
                        Only applicable when SecretRef.Key is specified.
                        If specified, the secret key's value is set as this environment variable.

                        Only applicable when MountPath is specified.
                        Defaults to 0600 (read/write for owner only) for security.
                        Use 0400 for read-only files like SSH keys.

                          where each key in the Secret becomes a file in the directory.

                      Example: To make pods match a NetworkPolicy with podSelector:
                        labels:
                          network-policy: agent-restricted

                  runtimeClassName:
                    description: |-
                      RuntimeClassName specifies the RuntimeClass to use for agent pods.
                      RuntimeClass provides a way to select container runtime configurations
                      such as gVisor (runsc) or Kata Containers for enhanced isolation.

                      This is useful when running untrusted AI agent code that may generate
                      and execute arbitrary commands. Using gVisor or Kata provides an
                      additional layer of security beyond standard container isolation.

                      The RuntimeClass must exist in the cluster before use.
                      Common values: "gvisor", "kata", "runc" (default if not specified)

                      Example:
                        runtimeClassName: gvisor

                                            MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                            be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                            incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                            to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                            for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                            pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                            The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                            Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                            This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                          NodeSelector specifies a selector for scheduling pods to specific nodes.
                          The pod will only be scheduled to nodes that have all the specified labels.

                          Example:
                            nodeSelector:

                          Tolerations allows pods to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints.

                          Example:
                            tolerations:
                              - key: "dedicated"

                            The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
                            the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.

                                Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                                When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                            key:

                                Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                                If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                                Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                                Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                                of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                                it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
