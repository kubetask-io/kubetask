          WorkspaceConfig defines the workspace environment for task execution.
          Workspace = AI agent + permissions + tools + infrastructure

                  DefaultContexts defines the base-level contexts that are included in all tasks
                  using this WorkspaceConfig. These contexts are applied at the lowest priority,
                  meaning Batch commonContext and variableContexts take precedence.

                  Context priority (lowest to highest):
                    1. WorkspaceConfig.defaultContexts (base layer)
                    2. Batch.commonContext (shared across all tasks in the batch)
                    3. Batch.variableContexts[i] (task-specific contexts)

                  Use this for organization-wide defaults like coding standards, security policies,
                  or common tool configurations that should apply to all tasks.

                  for the agent to use during task execution.

                  The tools image must follow the standard directory structure:
                    /tools/bin/  - Executables (added to PATH)
                    /tools/lib/  - Shared libraries and runtimes (e.g., node_modules)

                  When specified, the controller creates an initContainer that copies
                  /tools from this image to a shared volume, making the tools available
                  to the agent container via PATH environment variable.

                  This enables decoupling of agent and tools - each can be built and
                  versioned independently, and combined at runtime.
