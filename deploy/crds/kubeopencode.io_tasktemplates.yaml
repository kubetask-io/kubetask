          TaskTemplate defines a reusable template for Task creation.
          TaskTemplates allow users to define common Task configurations (contexts, agentRef)
          that can be shared across multiple Tasks. Similar to Argo WorkflowTemplate.

                        MountPath specifies where this context should be mounted in the agent pod.

                        Path resolution follows Tekton conventions:
                        - Absolute paths (starting with "/") are used as-is
                        - Relative paths (NOT starting with "/") are prefixed with the agent's workspaceDir

                        If not specified, the content is appended to task.md with XML tags.

                        Note: For Runtime context type, MountPath is ignored - content is always
                        appended to task.md.
