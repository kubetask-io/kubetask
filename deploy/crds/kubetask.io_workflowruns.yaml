          WorkflowRun represents an execution instance of a Workflow.
          WorkflowRun can be created in two ways:
           1. Reference an existing Workflow template via workflowRef
           2. Define an inline workflow via inline spec

          WorkflowRun is the owner of all Task CRs it creates.
          When a WorkflowRun is deleted, all its child Tasks are garbage collected.

          WorkflowRun follows the same TTL cleanup policy as Task, configured
          in KubeTaskConfig.spec.taskLifecycle.ttlSecondsAfterFinished.

                                            MountPath specifies where this context should be mounted in the agent pod.
                                            If specified, the context content is written to this file path.
                                            Example: "${WORKSPACE_DIR}/guides/coding-standards.md"

                                            If NOT specified (empty), the context content is appended to ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/task.md

                                            This allows multiple contexts to be aggregated into a single task.md file,
                                            which the agent can parse and understand.

                                      This is the primary way to tell the agent what to do.

                                      Example:

                                      When enabled, the agent container will remain running after task completion,
                                      allowing users to exec into the container for debugging, review, or manual intervention.

                                      IMPORTANT: When humanInTheLoop is enabled, the Agent MUST also specify the Command field.
                                      The controller wraps the command to add a sleep after completion.
                                      Without Command in the Agent, the controller cannot wrap the entrypoint.
